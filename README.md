# SatSo
SatSo reads [TatSu](https://tatsu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mini-tutorial.html?highlight=objects#object-models) objects, capturing clich√©s, remembering routines, alanogising algorithms to English, and back.

SatSo uses the [pai](https://github.com/jalanb/pai/blob/master/bin/bai) framework (which vaporizes [pym](https://pym.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to provide shells in increasingly easy and interesting [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)s to accept changes to the objects, and underlying code.
